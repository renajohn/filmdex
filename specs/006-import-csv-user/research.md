# Research: CSV Import Feature

## Decisions

### Backend
- **File Uploads**: `multer` will be used. It is a widely-used Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is ideal for file uploads.
- **CSV Parsing**: `csv-parser` will be used. It's a streaming parser that is efficient and easy to integrate.

### Frontend
- **File Uploads**: A standard `<input type="file">` element will be used. The `fetch` API will be used to send the file to the backend.

## Rationale

The chosen libraries are popular, well-documented, and have a proven track record in the Node.js ecosystem. They are also lightweight and will not add significant overhead to the application. The streaming nature of `csv-parser` is particularly important for handling potentially large CSV files efficiently without consuming too much memory.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Backend**:
  - `formidable`: Another popular choice for file uploads, but `multer` is more commonly used with Express.
  - `papaparse`: A powerful CSV parser that can also run in the browser, but for backend-only parsing, `csv-parser` is simpler and sufficient.
- **Frontend**:
  - `axios`: Could be used for file uploads, but `fetch` is built-in and sufficient for this use case.
  - `react-dropzone`: A library for creating a drag-and-drop file upload area. This could be a future enhancement, but for now, a simple file input is sufficient.
