# Implementation Plan: CSV Import

**Branch**: `006-import-csv-user` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-import-csv-user/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
The user wants to import movies from a CSV file. The system will process the CSV, enrich the data using TMDB and OMDB, and add the movies to the database. A UI will be provided for the user to resolve any movies that cannot be automatically matched.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js (backend), React (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: `multer`, `csv-parser` (backend), `react` (frontend)
**Storage**: The existing database will be used. The CSV file is discarded after import.
**Testing**: Existing testing frameworks will be used.
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Constraints**: CSV file size will be limited.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (frontend, backend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a feature of the existing application.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? No
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? N/A
- BUILD increments on every change? N/A
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See `data-model.md`, `contracts/api.yaml`, and `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
