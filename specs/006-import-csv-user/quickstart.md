# Quickstart: CSV Import

This guide will walk you through importing movies into your collection using a CSV file.

## 1. Prepare your CSV file

Create a CSV file with a `title` column. The following columns are also supported:

- `original_title`
- `comments`
- `price`
- `format`

## 2. Upload the CSV file

Use the new CSV import feature to upload your file. The system will start processing the file in the background.

## 3. Resolve unmatched movies

If the system can't automatically find a match for a movie, you will be prompted to resolve it manually. You can either provide more information or select from a list of suggestions.

## 4. Complete the import

Once all movies have been resolved, the import process is complete. All the movies from your CSV file will now be in your collection.
