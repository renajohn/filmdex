# Feature Specification: MusicDex

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "It's time to create the MusicDex. I want to create a new section of the app that manage my CD collection. I want to have the same features as filmdex, but start simple. Cover image must by downloaded in data/images/cd/ and all image should be local, imported from MusicBrainz. Re-use as much components as possible and keep a consistent theme. MusicDex should be another tab (FilmDex, MusicDex, Wish list which contains both music and films). Adding a new CD should be done by either scanning the code bar or searching with the CD title. When adding a CD, and when not using barcode, the process should be like Movie: first I look for the name of the CD then we can add the CD. I want to see: `type MusicDisc = { id: string; // your UUID artist: string[]; title: string; releaseYear?: number; labels?: string[]; // Label/Imprint catalogNumber?: string; barcode?: string; // EAN/UPC country?: string; editionNotes?: string; // e.g., 2011 remaster, pre-emphasis discs: { number: number; // 1..N toc?: string; // CD TOC for identification tracks: { no: number; title: string; durationSec?: number }[]; }[]; // this should be in a different table genres?: string[]; // rock, classical... moods?: string[]; // calm, energetic, night recordingQuality?: "demo" | "reference" | "good" | "average"; cover: // link to the CD art on disk musicbrainzReleaseId?: string; ownership: { condition?: "M"|"NM"|"VG+"|"VG"; notes?: string; purchasedAt?: string; priceChf?: number; }; createdAt: string; updatedAt: string; };` Editing a CD should be very reminiscent of how Movies are edited in FilmDex. Use MusicBrainz (open, great for editions/releases) + Cover Art Archive (free covers) if it is sufficient. Is that sufficient?"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage my CD collection within the app, so I can have a digital catalog of my music.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the MusicDex tab, **When** add a CD I can search for the CD by title and select the correct one, **Then** the CD is added to my collection.
2. **Given** I have a CD with a barcode, **When** I scan the barcode, **Then** the CD is automatically added to my collection.
3. **Given** a CD is in my collection, **When** I edit its details, **Then** the changes are saved.
4. **Given** I am on the Wish list tab, **When** I add a CD, **Then** it appears in my wish list.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a barcode is not found in the database?
  - fallback to searching CD by name
- How does the system handle multiple editions of the same CD?
  - it let the user select the one they want
- What happens if a cover image cannot be downloaded?
  - system will provide a placeholder

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "MusicDex" section to manage a user's CD collection.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow adding a CD by searching for its title.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow adding a CD by scanning its barcode.
- **FR-004**: System MUST download and store cover images locally in `data/images/cd/`.
- **FR-005**: System MUST extend the "Wish list" tab to also have music, like films.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to edit the details of a CD in their collection.
- **FR-007**: The user interface for MusicDex MUST be consistent with the existing FilmDex theme and components.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST reuse existing components where possible.
- **FR-009**: The process of adding a CD by title MUST be a two-step process: search, then add.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST use MusicBrainz as data sources.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MusicDisc**: Represents a CD in the user's collection.
  - **Attributes**: id, artist, title, releaseYear, labels, catalogNumber, barcode, country, editionNotes, discs, genres, moods, recordingQuality, cover, musicbrainzReleaseId, ownership, createdAt, updatedAt, tracks, track duration, track order.
