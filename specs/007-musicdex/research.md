## Data Sources

### MusicBrainz
- **Decision**: Use MusicBrainz as the primary source for CD metadata.
- **Rationale**: It's an open and comprehensive database for music information, including releases, artists, and tracks. The user specifically requested it.
- **Alternatives considered**: Discogs was considered, but MusicBrainz is generally preferred for its open data policy.

### Cover Art Archive
- **Decision**: Use Cover Art Archive for downloading cover images.
- **Rationale**: It's a joint project between the Internet Archive and MusicBrainz, and it's the recommended way to get cover art for MusicBrainz releases. It's also free.
- **Alternatives considered**: Other image sources were considered, but the direct integration with MusicBrainz makes Cover Art Archive the best choice.
