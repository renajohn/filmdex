# Feature Specification: Movie Collection App

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-an-simple`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: User description: "create an simple web app that classify all physical the movies I own. It should allow a connection to a google sheet to retrieve the initial list of moves and import them in a datastore of its own. It should allow search by mulitiple criterion."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to import my movie collection from a private Google Sheet into a web application so that I can easily search and manage my collection securely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Google Sheet with a list of movies, **When** I authenticate with Google and provide the Google Sheet URL to the application, **Then** the application imports the movies into its own datastore.
2. **Given** that I have imported my movie collection, **When** I search for a movie by title, **Then** the application displays the movie details.
3. **Given** that I have imported my movie collection, **When** I search for movies by genre, **Then** the application displays a list of movies that match the genre.
4. **Given** that I want to import movies, **When** I click "Authenticate with Google", **Then** I am redirected to Google's OAuth2 consent screen and can grant permissions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Google Sheet is not accessible?
- What happens when the Google Sheet has a different format than expected?
- What happens when a movie has missing information?
- What happens when OAuth2 authentication fails or expires?
- What happens when the user denies Google permissions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to authenticate with Google using OAuth2 to access private Google Sheets.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to import their movie collection from a Google Sheet.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST store the imported movie collection in its own datastore.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow users to search for movies by title.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow users to search for movies by genre.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow users to search for movies by other criteria: director, actor, year, medium type (blu ray, DVD, UHD).
- **FR-007**: The system MUST display the details of a movie when a user selects it from the search results. List of actors, year of creation, summary, rotten tomato rating and imdb rating.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST handle OAuth2 token refresh and re-authentication when tokens expire.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST automatically retrive the IMDB rating and rotten tomato rating if not provided.
- **FR-010**: The system SHOULD mark IMDB rating and rotten tomato rating as optional in the input form.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST offer users a way to manually enter new entries with a form.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST allow users to edit an existing entrie.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST allow users to export all movies as a CSV.
- **FR-014**: The system SHOULD allow users to export all movies as a google spreadsheet if they authenticated before hand.
- **FR-015**:  The system MUST read the google sheet to import and allow user to map their column title with the imported DB column title (for all imported fields). For instance: Title -> Move name, ...
