# Feature Specification: Data model refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `005-data-model-refactoring`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Data model refactoring. I want to refactor my data model for the movie collection app. I want to add the following fields: - original_title (TEXT) - original_language (TEXT) - rotten_tomatoes_link (TEXT) - imdb_link (TEXT) - tmdb_link (TEXT) - tmdb_rating (REAL) - price (REAL) - runtime (INTEGER) - comments (TEXT) - never_seen (BOOLEAN) No need to implemement database migration. Just add the new fields to the data model, I'll reimport the data later. Throughout the app, all CRUD operations should be updated to include the new fields. It should be clear in the codebase what is part of the data model and what is enriched data coming from external sources like OMDB and TMDB. When data is imported from the spreadsheet, any missing fields should be set completed based on information from OMDB and TMDB. Any fields that are not available should be set to null. The spreadsheet import model should be updated to include the new fields."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to expand the information stored for each movie in my collection so that I can track more details and have a richer dataset.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am adding a new movie, **When** I provide values for the new fields (e.g., original title, runtime, price), **Then** these values are saved correctly in the database.
2. **Given** I am viewing the details of a movie, **When** the movie has data for the new fields, **Then** this data is displayed on the movie details page.
3. **Given** I am importing movies from a spreadsheet, **When** the spreadsheet contains the new fields, **Then** the data is imported correctly into the new database fields.
4. **Given** I am importing movies from a spreadsheet, **When** some of the new fields are missing, **Then** the system attempts to fill them using OMDB and TMDB, and sets the rest to null.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a spreadsheet is imported with columns that don't map to any fields?
- How does the system handle invalid data types for the new fields (e.g., text in a REAL field)?
- What happens if the external APIs (OMDB/TMDB) are unavailable during import?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST extend the movie data model to include the new fields.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow creating, reading, updating, and deleting movies with the new fields.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST clearly differentiate between core data model fields and externally-sourced (enriched) data.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST update the spreadsheet import functionality to map to the new data model.
- **FR-005**: During import, the system MUST attempt to populate any missing fields by fetching data from OMDB and TMDB.
- **FR-006**: If data for a field is not available from any source during import, it MUST be set to `null`.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Movie**: Represents a single movie in the user's collection.
    - **Attributes**: 
        - `id` (INTEGER, Primary Key)
        - `title` (TEXT)
        - `year` (INTEGER)
        - `director` (TEXT)
        - `genre` (TEXT)
        - `rating` (REAL)
        - `poster_url` (TEXT)
        - `original_title` (TEXT)
        - `original_language` (TEXT)
        - `rotten_tomatoes_link` (TEXT)
        - `imdb_link` (TEXT)
        - `tmdb_link` (TEXT)
        - `tmdb_rating` (REAL)
        - `price` (REAL)
        - `runtime` (INTEGER)
        - `comments` (TEXT)
        - `never_seen` (BOOLEAN)
