# Feature Specification: Movie Detail View

**Feature Branch**: `003-detailed-info`
**Created**: 2025-09-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an extension of my personal movie database. As a user, I want to be able to click on one card, and get a detailed information card. This card should be in the spirit of what IMDB shows for a movie, or what themoviedb.org shows. It should be engaging and should provide as much information as possible. It must show the poster, the title, the plot, the genre, the IMDB and Rotten To mato ratings, the year, the format, the date of acquisition. It should also show informations retrieved from https://www.themoviedb.org/, like the age rating, the type, pictures of the cast with their name, and the link to the trailer. Loaded cached credentials."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user browsing my movie collection, I want to click on a movie card to see a detailed view with comprehensive information about that movie, so I can learn more about it without leaving the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the main movie listing page, **When** I click on a movie's card, **Then** a detailed information card for that movie is displayed.
2. **Given** the detailed information card is open, **When** I review the content, **Then** I see the movie's poster, title, plot, genre, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, year, format, and date of acquisition.
3. **Given** the detailed information card is open, **When** I review the content, **Then** I also see the age rating, type (e.g., movie, series), cast pictures with names, and a link to the trailer, sourced from The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a movie is missing information from The Movie Database?
   - The information is not displayed, a simple placeholder is displayed.
- What happens if the trailer link is broken or unavailable?
   - The trailer comes from themoviedb and if it is not available, the card should mention it.
- How does the system handle movies that are not found in The Movie Database?
   - The trailer is not displayed and a message says it's not available.
- What is displayed for fields where data is not available in the local database (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes rating is null)?
   - A simple dash (-)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a detailed information card when a user clicks on a movie card.
- **FR-002**: The detailed information card MUST display all fields available from the local database: title, plot, genre, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, year, format, and date of acquisition.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST fetch additional information for the selected movie from The Movie Database (themoviedb.org).
- **FR-004**: The detailed information card MUST display the following fields from The Movie Database: poster, age, duration, age rating, type, cast (pictures and names), and a link to the official trailer.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST use cached credentials for accessing The Movie Database API.
- **FR-006**: The detailed view MUST be engaging and presented in a style similar to IMDB or The Movie Database.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST gracefully handle cases where some or all information from The Movie Database is unavailable for a given movie. When not available, use a grayed out placeholder.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST gracefully handle cases where data fields from the local database are empty or null. Use a consistant placeholder like FR-07.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Movie**: Represents a single movie in the user's personal database. Key attributes include: Title, Plot, Genre, IMDB Rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating, Year, Format, Date of Acquisition.
- **Movie Details (External)**: Represents the additional data fetched from The Movie Database. Key attributes include: Poster, Age Rating, Type, Cast (with pictures and names), Trailer Link.
