# Research: Movie Detail View

## TMDB API Integration
- **Decision**: Use the `axios` library in the backend to make requests to the TMDB API.
- **Rationale**: `axios` is already a dependency and is well-suited for making HTTP requests.
- **Alternatives considered**: `node-fetch`, but `axios` is already in the project.

## UI Design
- **Decision**: Create a new React component `MovieDetailCard.js` that will be displayed when a movie is clicked. The design will be inspired by IMDB and TMDB, with a prominent poster, a clear layout for information, and a section for cast members with images.
- **Rationale**: A dedicated component will be easy to manage and style. The design should be familiar to users.
- **Alternatives considered**: A modal window, but a dedicated card view will feel more integrated into the application.

## Clarifications
- **Performance**: The API calls to TMDB should be cached to improve performance. The UI should render quickly, with placeholders for images while they are loading.
- **Browser Support**: The application should support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Logging**: Use a simple console logger for now. If the application grows, a more robust logging library like `winston` could be added.
- **Error Reporting**: Errors will be logged to the console. For user-facing errors, a simple message will be displayed.
