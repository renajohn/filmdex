# Implementation Plan: Movie Detail View

**Branch**: `003-detailed-info` | **Date**: 2025-09-12 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-detailed-info/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature will extend the personal movie database by adding a detailed movie information card. When a user clicks on a movie, a card will display comprehensive details, including information from the local database and additional data fetched from The Movie Database API.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js (backend), JavaScript (frontend), React
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Backend: `express`, `sqlite3`, `axios`, `googleapis`, `dotenv`
- Frontend: `react`, `react-dom`, `react-scripts`, `@testing-library/react`
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**:
- Backend: `jest`, `supertest`
- Frontend: `jest`, `@testing-library/react`
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the performance expectations for API response time and UI rendering?]
**Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there any specific constraints regarding browser support or other factors?]
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected number of users or movies in the database?]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (frontend, backend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a web application.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is a structured logging library in use?]
- Frontend logs → backend? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a requirement to send frontend logs to the backend?]
- Error context sufficient? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the requirements for error reporting?]

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Yes
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Yes

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research performance expectations for similar web applications.
   - Research common browser support constraints.
   - Research best practices for structured logging in Node.js and React.
   - Research error reporting strategies for web applications.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Task: "Research best practices for integrating The Movie Database (TMDB) API"
   - Task: "Find examples of engaging movie detail card UI designs"

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`
2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `/contracts/api.yaml`
3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts.
4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`
5. **Update agent file incrementally**

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/api.yaml`, failing tests, `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs.
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Backend (models, services, api) before Frontend (services, components).
- Mark [P] for parallel execution.

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
