## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to search for a movie, edit its details, and add it to my collection. I also want to be able to save my collection back to a spreadsheet and edit movie properties.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the "Add Movie" page, **When** I type a movie title in the search box, **Then** I should see a list of matching movies.
2. **Given** I see a list of movies, **When** I select one, **Then** I am taken to a page where I can edit the movie's details. I can only change the properties imported by the spreadsheet.
3. **Given** I am on the "Add Movie" page, **When** I choose the manual entry option, **Then** I am presented with a form to enter movie details manually, bypassing the movie search and selection.
4. **Given** I have edited a movie's details, **When** I click "Add Movie", **Then** the movie is added to my collection.
5. **Given** I have added movies to my collection, **When** I choose to save to spreadsheet, **Then** the new movies are added to the spreadsheet file. Only new and modified movies are saved in the spreadsheet and only the fields known by the app are modified.
6. **Given** I am viewing the details of a movie, **When** I edit the movie, **Then** I can change any properties that are coming from the spreadsheet.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the movie search returns no results?
  - user can do a different search or insert all details manually
- How does the system handle a failed attempt to save the spreadsheet?
  - failed with an error
- What happens if a user tries to add a movie that is already in the collection but not from the original spreadsheet?
  - it merges the 2 entries to keep the movie title unique
