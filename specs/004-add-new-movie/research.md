# Research: TMDB API for Movie Search

## Summary
To implement the movie search functionality, we will use the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. This API provides a simple way to search for movies and retrieve their details.

## API Usage
1.  **API Key:** An API key is required for all requests. This needs to be obtained from the TMDB website.
2.  **Endpoint:** The endpoint for searching movies is `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie`.
3.  **Request:** A GET request is made to the endpoint with the following query parameters:
    *   `api_key`: The TMDB API key.
    *   `query`: The movie title to search for.
4.  **Response:** The API returns a JSON object with a list of movie results, including details like title, overview, release date, and poster path.

## Example
`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&query=Inception`
