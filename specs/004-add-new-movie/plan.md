# Implementation Plan: Add New Movie Flow

**Branch**: `004-add-new-movie` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-add-new-movie/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of the "Add New Movie" feature. The user will be able to search for movies using the TMDB API, add them to their collection, and save the updated collection back to a spreadsheet.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js (backend), React (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js, React
**Storage**: Filesystem (for the spreadsheet)
**Testing**: Jest
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: N/A

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (frontend, backend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? N/A
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? N/A

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? N/A
- BUILD increments on every change? N/A
- Breaking changes handled? N/A
