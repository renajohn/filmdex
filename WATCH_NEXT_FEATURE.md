# Watch Next Feature

This feature allows you to mark movies for future "popcorn sessions" with a simple toggle interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `watch_next` BOOLEAN column to the `movies` table
- Automatic migration on backend boot
- Default value: `false` (0)

### 2. Backend API
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/movies/:id/watch-next`
- **Action:** Toggles the watch_next status
- **Response:** `{ id: number, watch_next: boolean }`

### 3. Frontend Components

#### WatchNextToggle Component
- Location: `frontend/src/components/WatchNextToggle.js`
- Displays a popcorn emoji (üçø) that fills/unfills on toggle
- **Easy Icon Switching:** Change the `ICON_CONFIG.type` from `'popcorn'` to `'star'` to experiment with star icons (‚≠ê/‚òÜ)

```javascript
// To switch to star icons, change this line in WatchNextToggle.js:
const ICON_CONFIG = {
  type: 'star', // Change from 'popcorn' to 'star'
  // ...
};
```

#### Movie Detail View
- **Full action button** appears alongside "Play Trailer" and "Delete Movie"
- Shows star icon (outline when inactive, filled when active)
- Button text changes: "Add to Watch Next" / "Remove from Watch Next"
- Styled with golden amber theme when active
- Shows success message when toggled

#### Movie Grid/List
- **Professional star toggle** appears on every movie poster (bottom-left corner)
- **Polished design:**
  - Clean gradient backgrounds (no blur for better poster visibility)
  - Subtle inner light effect
  - Rounded square button (modern, clean, 36x36px)
- **Visual states:**
  - Inactive: Semi-transparent dark background, white star outline
  - Hover: Darker background, brightens and scales up
  - Active: Golden star filled with amber glow and gentle pulse
- **Instant feedback:** Updates immediately when clicked (optimistic UI)
- **No need to open detail view** - toggle directly from the grid
- Positioned at bottom-left to avoid conflicting with age rating badge
- Minimal poster obstruction when inactive

### 4. Filtering
- **Filter Button:** "Watch Next" appears in the filter pills when movies are marked
- Shows count of movies in watch next list
- Click to filter and show only Watch Next movies
- Uses popcorn emoji (üçø) as the filter icon

## User Experience

### Simple Toggle Flow

**From Grid View (Fastest!):**
1. See the star icon at bottom-left of any movie poster
2. Click it to instantly toggle on/off
3. Watch it light up and pulse when active
4. No page changes, instant response!

**From Detail View:**
1. Open any movie's detail view
2. Click the star toggle below the title
3. See confirmation message
4. Movie is now marked for "Watch Next"

### Quick Filter
1. Look for the "üçø Watch Next (N)" filter pill
2. Click to show only movies marked for watching
3. Click "All" or the filter again to show all movies

## Technical Details

### Icon Configuration
The popcorn/star icon is controlled by a single constant in `WatchNextToggle.js`:

```javascript
const ICON_CONFIG = {
  type: 'popcorn', // or 'star'
  icons: {
    popcorn: { filled: 'üçø', outline: 'üçø', title: 'Watch Next' },
    star: { filled: '‚≠ê', outline: '‚òÜ', title: 'Watch Next' }
  }
};
```

Just change `type: 'popcorn'` to `type: 'star'` to experiment with different icons!

### Database Migration
The migration runs automatically when the backend starts. It checks if the `watch_next` column already exists before attempting to add it, so it's safe to run multiple times.

### API Integration
- Frontend: `apiService.toggleWatchNext(movieId)`
- Backend: `Movie.toggleWatchNext(id)` using SQL `SET watch_next = NOT watch_next`
