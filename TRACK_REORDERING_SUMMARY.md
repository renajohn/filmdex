# Track Reordering Feature - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Changed

The track editing feature has been enhanced with **drag-and-drop reordering capabilities**.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Automatic Track Numbering**
- Track numbers are now **automatically calculated** based on position in the list
- No more manual track number input - track position = track number
- Numbers automatically update when tracks are reordered or deleted

### 2. **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**
- Simply drag tracks to reorder them within a disc
- Visual feedback during drag operations:
  - **Grip handle icon** (⋮⋮) indicates draggable rows
  - **50% opacity** on dragged track
  - **Blue highlight** background on dragged track
  - **3px blue left border** on dragged track
  - **Green drop indicator line** shows exactly where track will be inserted
  - **Subtle green glow** under the drop indicator for better visibility
  - Helpful hint: "Drag tracks to reorder"

### 3. **Improved UX**
- Track number field removed from edit dialog (auto-calculated)
- Title field auto-focused when editing
- Smooth transitions and visual feedback
- Prevents cross-disc dragging (tracks stay within their disc)

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### Before:
```
| # | Title           | Duration | Actions |
|---|-----------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Track One       | 3:45     | ✏️ 🗑️   |
| 2 | Track Two       | 4:12     | ✏️ 🗑️   |
```

### After:
```
Drag tracks to reorder ⋮⋮

| ⋮⋮ | # | Title           | Duration | Actions |
|----|---|-----------------|----------|---------|
| ⋮⋮ | 1 | Track One       | 3:45     | ✏️ 🗑️   |
| ⋮⋮ | 2 | Track Two       | 4:12     | ✏️ 🗑️   |
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Added `draggedTrack` state to track current drag operation
- Added `dropTarget` state to track where the track will be dropped
- Track numbers recalculated on every track operation (add, edit, delete, reorder)

### Drag-and-Drop Handlers
```javascript
handleTrackDragStart(e, discIndex, trackIndex)  // Start drag, set opacity
handleTrackDragEnd(e)                           // Clean up, reset opacity and drop target
handleTrackDragOver(e, discIndex, trackIndex)   // Allow drop, show drop indicator
handleTrackDrop(e, targetDiscIndex, targetTrackIndex) // Reorder and renumber
```

### Auto-Numbering
All track operations now call renumbering:
```javascript
disc.tracks = tracks.map((track, idx) => ({
  ...track,
  trackNumber: idx + 1
}));
```

## 📝 Usage

### Reordering Tracks
1. Look for the grip icon (⋮⋮) on the left of each track row
2. Click and hold on any track row
3. Drag the track to its new position
4. Release to drop
5. Track numbers automatically update

### Example Workflow
1. Add album with tracks in wrong order
2. Drag track 5 to position 2
3. Tracks automatically renumber:
   - Old track 2 → becomes track 3
   - Old track 3 → becomes track 4
   - Old track 4 → becomes track 5
   - Old track 5 → becomes track 2

## 🧪 Testing

All drag-and-drop scenarios tested:
- ✅ Drag track up in list
- ✅ Drag track down in list
- ✅ Drag to first position
- ✅ Drag to last position
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag (opacity, borders)
- ✅ **Green drop indicator shows insertion point**
- ✅ Drop target updates in real-time while dragging
- ✅ Track numbers update correctly
- ✅ Cannot drag across discs
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Responsive and smooth UX

## 📦 Files Modified

- `/frontend/src/components/MusicForm.js`
  - Added drag-and-drop handlers
  - Added grip icon column
  - Implemented auto-numbering logic
  - Enhanced visual feedback
  - Removed manual track number input

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Faster workflow**: Reorder tracks with simple drag-and-drop
2. **Less errors**: No manual track numbering mistakes
3. **Better UX**: Visual feedback makes it clear what's happening
4. **Intuitive**: Grip handles are a familiar UI pattern
5. **Consistent**: Track numbers always match position
6. **Clear drop target**: Green line shows exactly where track will be inserted
